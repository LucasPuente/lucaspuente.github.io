<p>The unpopular yet seemingly pervasive practice of gerrymandering may have may its match: programmer <a href="http://bolson.org/resume/">Brian Olson</a>. Using the 2010 census data, Olson developed a program to automate the process of redrawing legislative districts (on both the state and federal level). He improves on previous efforts by not simply <a href="http://rangevoting.org/SplitLR.html">drawing lines that minimize district size</a>, but by making districts as compact as possible without putting one neighborhood (i.e. census tract)* in more than one district. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of the result: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/06/03/this-computer-programmer-solved-gerrymandering-in-his-spare-time/?wpisrc=nl_wnkpm"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tumblr_inline_n6mzoloP131rkn0fa.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><span>While this is an exciting development and I think state legislators would be wise to implement a version of  Brian&rsquo;s work, we (probably) shouldn&rsquo;t view this as a panacea. As John Sides has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/02/03/gerrymandering-is-not-whats-wrong-with-american-politics/">argued</a>, &ldquo;gerrymandering is not what’s wrong with American politics.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>*According to the </span><a href="http://www.census.gov/geo/reference/gtc/gtc_ct.html">Census Bureau</a><span>, &ldquo;c</span><span>ensus tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people.  A census tract usually covers a contiguous area; however, the spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.&rdquo;</span></p></p>
