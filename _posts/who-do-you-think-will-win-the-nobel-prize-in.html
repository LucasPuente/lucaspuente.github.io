<p>On Monday, the Nobel committee will announce who will be awarded their Prize in Economic Sciences. The winner will get <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/12/world/nobel-prize-fast-facts/index.html">a medal, a personal diploma, and a cash prize</a> (8 million Swedish Krona or ~$1.2 million).</p>

<p>Fun fact: Franco Modigliani <a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2003/modigliani.html">used some of his $225,000 Nobel Prize money to upgrade his laser-class sailboat</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So who are the front-runners? According to British betting house Paddy Power, the favorite (at 4/1 odds) is Yale housing and financial economist <a href="http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/">Robert Schiller</a>. Tied for second at 5/1 are Harvard macroeconomist Robert Barro, LSE econometrician <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/researchAndExpertise/Experts/a.c.atkinson@lse.ac.uk">Anthony Atkinson</a>, and NYU development economist Paul Romer. <span>Here&rsquo;s the full set of odds:</span></p>

<p>While whoever wins this award will no doubt have a career defining moment when they receive the phone call, it doesn&rsquo;t actually mean their reputation in the field will change that much. According to research by Samuel Bjork, Avner Offer, and Gabriel Söderberg in <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-013-0989-5">Scientometrics</a>, winning the Nobel provides a small boost to citations in the short-run, but then citations begin to decline. As <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/08/nobel-prize-economics%20">The Economist</a> explains, &quot;people tend to win Nobel prizes when their career has nearly reached its peak. The Swedish Academy, which makes the award, plays it safe.&ldquo;<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tumblr_inline_muexhyrLzk1rkn0fa.png" /></p>
<p>Anyways, I&rsquo;m looking forward to finding out who wins!</p>
