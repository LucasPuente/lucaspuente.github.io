<p>By presidential decree, I am one of the best drivers in the state of California. Wait, what?? Before you <strike>call bullshit</strike> stop reading this, t<span>here is actually an element of truth to this. Let me explain.</span></p>
<p><span>Two weeks ago, I drove one of the vans in President Obama&rsquo;s motorcade during <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/nation-world/ci_23408050/tweets-from-president-obamas-silicon-valley-visit-june">his trip to Silicon Valley</a>. I had always figured all those drivers were cops or Secret Service officers (and several are), but</span><span> when he is traveling outside of DC his <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/03/17/174542931/planning-trips-worthy-of-a-president">advance team</a> also </span><span>solicits volunteers to drive around his entourage of staffers and reporters. Through a friend of a friend of a friend (gotta love network effects), I was offered the chance  to participate. </span></p>
<p><span>After signing up and getting my &ldquo;driver clearance,&rdquo; I received instructions to show up at the Fairmont Hotel in San Jose on Thursday afternoon. Two of my classmates (one of which was the source of the connection) and I rode down together and began our short stint as part of the Obama team. </span></p>
<p>After getting our initial briefing there, we headed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moffett_Federal_Airfield">Moffett Field</a>, where Air Force One would arrive.<img alt="image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tumblr_inline_moi2nczFyk1qz4rgp.jpg" /></p>
<p>While waiting, we got to check out Obama&rsquo;s ride, nicknamed &ldquo;the beast.&rdquo; Needless to say, these <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVEBZLrjpw4">two black Cadillacs</a> were pretty sweet.</p>

<p>The operation at the airport was very well coordinated and everything went smoothly.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tumblr_inline_moi29yuiOb1qz4rgp.jpg" /></p>
<p>        These guys don&rsquo;t mess around!</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tumblr_inline_moi2frUpg31qz4rgp.jpg" /></p>
<p>        Welcome (back) to Silicon Valley, Mr. President.</p>
<p>As soon as the boss was off the plane, we had to get going.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tumblr_inline_moi2lziyrG1qz4rgp.jpg" /></p>
<p>Staffers scurried into my van and we were off. O<span>ur first stop was Palo Alto for a </span><span></span><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/video/flipboard-ceo-hosts-obama-reception-012508238.html">reception</a><span> </span><span>at the house of Mike (CEO of </span><a href="http://flipboard.com/">Flipboard</a><span>) and Marci McCune.</span></p>
<p><img alt="image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tumblr_inline_moi2yvnpdH1qz4rgp.jpg" /></p>
<p>After about an hour there, we were on our way to the second (and final) event of the night in Portola Valley.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tumblr_inline_moi32kHmAh1qz4rgp.jpg" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/food-wine/ci_23412842/what-obama-ate-palo-alto-presidential-dinner-menu">dinner</a> at the house of Vinod (venture capitalist) and Neeru Khosla sounded amazing, but I unfortunately couldn&rsquo;t afford the $32,400 chicken saltimbocca so I just ate a pre-made <span>Trade Joe&rsquo;s salad and hung out with the staffers and volunteers outside.</span></p>
<p><img alt="image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tumblr_inline_moi3fv5TzQ1qz4rgp.jpg" /></p>
<p>We wrapped up our day with an uneventful trip back to the Fairmont. From there, I headed home, got a few hours of sleep, and then drove back to San Jose early the next day. Once there, our advance team liaison delivered some excited news: we would get to meet the president before taking him back to Moffett Field for his departure for LA.  While I had already met him a few times while interning in his Senate office, I hadn&rsquo;t seem him in person since his inauguration. Needless to say, it was pretty cool to <strike>talk basketball</strike> shake his hand and get our picture taken with him.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tumblr_inline_moi3xt5jBd1qz4rgp.jpg" /></p>
<p>To c<span>ome full circle, it was during this exchange that President Obama deemed our group &ldquo;the best drivers in California.&rdquo; So, I&rsquo;ll be expecting a discount on my next car insurance bill (*paging State Farm*). </span></p>
<p><span>All in all, it was a great experience. I think about politics a lot in my day-to-day life as a PhD candidate, but I don&rsquo;t often get to live it out. So while I won&rsquo;t be dropping out of grad school to pursue a career doing this sort of thing full time, it was a really fun and memorable 24 hours. I am very grateful for having this opportunity and highly recommend it for anyone asked to participate when Obama comes to their town.</span></p>
