<p>Jill and I are moving this summer so I figured I should check out our new neighborhood&rsquo;s partisan identity and compare that to where we live now and where we are from. Precinct-level <a href="https://sites.stanford.edu/sssl/2008-obamamccain-vote-precinct">data</a> on presidential voting have been collected by the <a href="https://sites.stanford.edu/sssl/">Stanford Spatial Social Science Lab</a> for the 2008 election so that&rsquo;s what I used (the 2012 data are still being coded).</p>
<p>Our current neighborhood in East Palo Alto is pretty damn liberal: out of 431 votes cast in 2008, 403 were for Obama. In other words, Obama beat McCain by 88% in our current EPA precinct. </p>
<p><img alt="image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tumblr_inline_mmx5o6tZtC1qz4rgp.png" /></p>
<p>Our new neighborhood is the Marina district of San Francisco. While San Francisco is undisputedly one of the most liberal major cities in America, the Marina has a reputation of its own. Here&rsquo;s how one <a href="http://www.thebolditalic.com/drewhoolhorst/stories/1958-moving-to-san-francisco">blogger</a> described it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beautiful, sweeping views of the Golden Gate Bridge. Boats &lsquo;n shit if you&rsquo;re into that. The apartment buildings may as well have Greek letters on them. If you aren&rsquo;t good looking, weren&rsquo;t in the Greek system in college and/or a billionaire, it&rsquo;s going to be really hard to get laid here, and this is in no way indicative of the author&rsquo;s troubles trying to do so here in his early twenties. In no way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While that&rsquo;s obviously a stereotype, I still would not have been surprised to see a more conservative tilt in the Marina relative to the rest of the city. In reality, the precinct we are moving into voted for Obama at exactly the same rate (84%) as the <a href="http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/results/states/president/california.html">city as a whole</a>. </p>
<p><img alt="image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tumblr_inline_mmx5oiiDKR1qz4rgp.png" /></p>
<p>Regardless, it&rsquo;s still funny that, by moving to San Francisco, we are moving into a more conservative city. That is, in 2008, 94% of East Palo Alto residents voted for Obama, a full ten percentage point difference with &ldquo;the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, this whole being surrounded by <strike>liberals</strike> like-minded voters is pretty new to us (though we did go to college in Athens, GA an oasis of blue among a sea of red). Both of these areas are far bluer than our respective hometowns. My parents&rsquo; precinct in Wilmington, NC (where I grew up) voted pretty overwhelmingly for McCain: he had a margin of victory there of 36.8% (1,645 to 760). </p>
<p><img alt="image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tumblr_inline_mmx6pumrPf1qz4rgp.png" /></p>
<p>Similarly, where Jill grew up (Tyrone, GA &ndash; just south of ATL), more than three-quarters of voters went for McCain.</p>
