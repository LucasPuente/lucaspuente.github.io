<p>The bike lobby is a hot topic these days on the interwebs. Ever since Wall Street Journal editorial board member Dorothy Rabinowitz&rsquo;s rant against the &ldquo;all powerful bike lobby&quot; (see my original <a href="http://lucaspuente.tumblr.com/post/52151658925/the-all-powerful-bike-lobby">post</a> here), people haven&rsquo;t stopped talking about the political activities of cyclists &ndash; especially the <a href="http://on.wsj.com/1alUSvc">WSJ</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ByronTau">Byron Tau</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/caitlinzemma">Caitlin Emma</a>, reporters for Politico, posted an <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/the-bike-lobby-rolls-on-92873.html">article</a> on the subject yesterday and offered a realistic interpretation of the actual influence of said group:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All-powerful the bike lobby is not. Cars — and the infrastructure needed to accommodate them — receive an overwhelming percentage of federal, state and local transportation dollars. But a scrappy band of bicycle manufacturers, smart-growth advocates and cycling nonprofits is increasingly fighting — and winning — battles at all levels of government.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This trend will likely continue as such groups expand their collective action efforts and develop a lobbying / electoral apparatus. One sign that this is indeed happening: the NY Times <a href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/political-action-from-the-bike-lobby/?smid=tw-nytmetro">reports</a> that <a href="http://www.streetspac.org/">StreetsPAC</a>, a coalition of &quot;advocates for cycling and pedestrian safety,&rdquo; just offered its first formal <a href="http://www.streetspac.org/endorsements_round1">endorsements</a> of city council candidates. Out here, the San Francisco Bike Coalition <a href="http://www.sfbike.org/?vote">flexed its muscles</a> in the 2012 election for the  Board of Supervisors and continues to engage local officials to make the city&rsquo;s roads more bike friendly.<img alt="image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tumblr_inline_molti2jsqG1qz4rgp.jpg" /></p>
<p>Still, despite growing every day, it&rsquo;s hard to disagree with Politico&rsquo;s Tau and Emma: the bike lobby is, undeniably, far from all powerful. As it emerges from its infancy, though, that could change. Personally, I hope so. That would level the playing field a bit in the debate over the future of urban transportation policy.</p>
