<p>My <span class="il">friend</span> <a href="http://www.stephenpettigrew.com/"><span class="il">Stephen</span> Pettigrew</a>, a PhD candidate in the Department of Government at Harvard, and I recently published a <a href="http://regressing.deadspin.com/the-college-gameday-curse-is-real-for-some-teams-1626753840">post</a> on Deadspin’s <a href="http://regressing.deadspin.com/">Regressing</a> blog.</p>
<p>The question we ask is how different college football teams have performed when featured in the national spotlight of ESPN’s College Gameday. To do so, we compare their outcomes in such games to otherwise comparable games. In other words, we ask do any of the teams regularly featured on Gameday suffer from a “Gameday curse” and do some of them even potentially benefit from a “Gameday bump”?</p>
<p>To answer this question, we use the statistical method of matching on observables. The results we derive are displayed in the graph below and the full writeup is available <a href="http://regressing.deadspin.com/the-college-gameday-curse-is-real-for-some-teams-1626753840">here</a>. <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tumblr_inline_ncc61oKJc91rkn0fa.png" alt="image" /></p>
