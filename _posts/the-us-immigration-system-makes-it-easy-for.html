<blockquote class="long">
<p>The U.S. immigration system makes it easy for sports stars to work in America, but the system makes it hard for star scientists, would-be entrepreneurs and others to show their stuff here. Imagine if the current or proposed visa and immigration rules for determining who can come to the U.S. to work applied to athletes.</p>
<p>First there would be a low cap on the number of foreign players allowed into the country each year, one well below what the market demands. The total number of foreign players might be limited to a dozen a year, across all sports, with no team allowed more than one.</p>
<p>But first the players would be told wait years, even a decade, before joining their teams. Teams would have to prove that they advertised the position and tried to hire an American first, but couldn’t find one. This is essentially how the H1-B visa system for high-skill immigrants works.</p>
<p>Oh, and there would be limits on how many players could come from any one country, and each country would be given the same number of slots in the name of fairness. Too bad for the NHL: That would mean 10 slots for hockey players from Canada, 10 from Tanzania and 10 from the Philippines. But at least everyone would get an equal chance. That’s how current caps on employment visas work, with no country allowed more than 7% of the total. It’s a system that treats China and Chad the same.</p>
